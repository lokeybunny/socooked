## CORE PRINCIPLES

- Design-first, not code-first
- Brand identity before layout
- Minimal but expressive
- Strong visual hierarchy
- High contrast
- Generous whitespace
- Subtle motion only
- Mobile-first

## ALWAYS INCLUDE IMAGES

Every generated prompt must force imagery.

If real assets are not provided, use placeholders:

- `/placeholder.svg?height=600&width=800` (hero)
- `/placeholder.svg?height=400&width=400` (cards/products)
- `/placeholder.svg?height=120&width=120` (avatars/icons)

Images must appear in:

- Hero
- Feature sections
- Card grids
- Galleries / products
- Testimonials when applicable

Never omit images.
